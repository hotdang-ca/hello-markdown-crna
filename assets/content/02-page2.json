  "content": "An h2 header\n------------\n\nHere's a numbered list:\n\n 1. first item\n 2. second item\n 3. third item\n\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters from the left side). Here's a code sample:\n\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\n    \nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\n\n~~~\ndefine foobar() {\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\n}\n~~~\n\n(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\n\n~~~python\nimport time\n# Quick, count to ten!\nfor i in range(10):\n    # (but not *too* quick)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print i\n~~~\n"
